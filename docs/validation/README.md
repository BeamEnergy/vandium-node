# Validation

Vandium provides the ability to validate properties of the `event` object in the lambda handler.  Validation can be performed on basic types,
objects, arrays and nested values. Vandium's validation system uses [Joi (version 8.4.x)](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) internally and thus most of its functionality may be used.
