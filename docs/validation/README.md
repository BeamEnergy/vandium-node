# Validation

Vandium allows validations on basic types, objects and arrays. Additionally validation can be performed on nested values inside objects and arrays. Vandium's validation system uses [joi (version 8.0.x)](https://github.com/hapijs/joi/tree/v8.0.5) internally and thus most of its functionality may be used.
