# `s3` Event type

The `s3` event type is a record-based event type and can contain one or more records. For many operations, there will only be a single record. The following is a sample record from the AWS Lambda documentation:

```JSON
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "eventVersion": "2.0",
            "eventTime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
            "requestParameters": {
                "sourceIPAddress": "127.0.0.1"
            },
            "s3": {
                "configurationId": "testConfigRule",
                "object": {
                    "sequencer": "0A1B2C3D4E5F678901",
                    "key": "HappyFace.jpg"
                },
                "bucket": {
                    "arn": "bucketarn",
                    "name": "sourcebucket",
                    "ownerIdentity": {
                        "principalId": "EXAMPLE"
                    }
                },
                "s3SchemaVersion": "1.0"
            },
            "responseElements": {
                "x-amz-id-2": "EXAMPLE123/5678abcdefghijklambdaisawesome/mnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGH",
                "x-amz-request-id": "EXAMPLE123456789"
            },
            "awsRegion": "us-east-1",
            "eventName": "ObjectRemoved:Delete",
            "userIdentity": {
                "principalId": "EXAMPLE"
            },
            "eventSource": "aws:s3"
        }
    ]
}
```

To map the event using Vandium, we would use the `s3()` handler:

```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

// handler for an s3 event
exports.handler = vandium.s3( (records) => {

        // assume that we only have 1 record
        let bucket = record[0].s3.bucket.name;
        let key = record[0].s3.object.key;

        console.log( `event triggered on bucket: ${bucket}, key: ${key}` );
    });
```

The `s3` event handler supports the `finally` operation to release allocated resources at the end of each execution.


```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

// handler for an s3 event
exports.handler = vandium.s3( (records) => {

        // assume that we only have 1 record
        let bucket = record[0].s3.bucket.name;
        let key = record[0].s3.object.key;

        console.log( `event triggered on bucket: ${bucket}, key: ${key}` );
    })
    .finally( () => {

        // release resources here
    });
```
